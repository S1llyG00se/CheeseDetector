# 🧀 CheeseDetector 🧀

Welcome to **CheeseDetector**! This is a fun, fictional project written in the equally fictional programming language **Mouse3**. The goal of this project is to simulate detecting cheese within a 4D space. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with **CheeseDetector**, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary "dependencies" listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of **Mouse3** installed. You can download it from our imaginary package manager. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CheeseDetector.git
    cd CheeseDetector
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    imaginary-pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📄 main.py Script

Here's a brief overview of what the `main.py` script does:

- **Imports necessary cheese modules**: `camembert`, `stilton`, `roquefort`, `limburger`, `hyperspace`, and `quantum_cheese`.
- **Contains a global variable** for the cheese detection threshold.
- **Defines functions** to open and close the hyperspace portal, and to detect cheese within a 4D matrix.
- **Detects cheese locations** based on the provided threshold.

### Usage

To run the **CheeseDetector** script, simply execute the `main.py` file using **Mouse3**:

```bash
mouse3 main.py
```
